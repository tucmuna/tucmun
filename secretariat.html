She started her MUN journey with HIMUNC in her sixth-grade year as a way to hang out with her friends, which has resulted in her developing an unanticipated love for public speaking and diplomacy. Since then, Anjana has spent her last few years chairing MMSMUN XII,  attending seventeen conferences and winning several awards, the most notable being an honorable mention at the Global Citizens Model United Nations. Although most of her life revolves around Model UN these days, you’ll also find her writing  poetry, singing along to Taylor Swift, reading, or hanging out with her best friends. Anjana is also the General Manager of the MUN Club as well as the Chief Publications Officer and Head of Social Media for the James River Academy of Diplomacy, a nonprofit centered around making Model UN more accessible for everyone. Anjana is super excited for TUCMUN I and encourages delegates to just be themselves, try their best, and make sure to have lots of fun.
